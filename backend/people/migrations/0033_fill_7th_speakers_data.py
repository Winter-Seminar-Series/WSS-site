He serves as a Security Science Fellow of the Institute for Security Science and Technology, leads the Systems and Algorithms Laboratory, and is an Academic Fellow of the Data Science Institute. . In his industrial role, he is a Visiting Professor and the Chief Scientist at Brave Software where he works on developing privacy-preserving analytics protocols. He is interested in User-Centred Systems, IoT, Applied Machine Learning, and Data Security & Privacy. He enjoys designing and building systems that enable better use of our digital footprint, while respecting users' privacy.


He studied for BEng/MSc/PhD at University College London and the University of Cambridge. He was a postdoctoral researcher at Max Planck Institute for Software Systems in Germany, and a postdoctoral research fellow at Department of Pharmacology, University of Cambridge and The Royal Veterinary College, University of London, followed by few years as a Lecturer and consequently Senior Lecturer in Digital Media at Queen Mary University of London. He has spent time working and collaborating with Brave Software, Intel Research, Microsoft Research, AT&T Research, Telefonica, and Sony Europe. When not in the lab, he prefers to be on a ski slope or in a kayak.'''
