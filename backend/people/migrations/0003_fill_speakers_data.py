In 2001 he published what was widely regarded as the definitive book on Approximation Algorithms. This book has been translated into four languages. His research on algorithms for the maximum matching problem spans four decades and on market equilibria spans two decades. His current research interest is algorithms for matching markets. He is an ACM Fellow and a Guggenheim Fellow.'
