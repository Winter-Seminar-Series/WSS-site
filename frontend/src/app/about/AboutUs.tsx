                The Winter Seminar Series (WSS) has been established to bring
                together successful Iranians from around the world and build a
                professional community focused on computer science and
                engineering topics. Over the years, this seminar has grown to
                become one of the premier events at the Sharif University of
                Technology. WSS is open to anyone who works in or is interested
                in computer science topics and seeks to share and express their
                ideas and research.

                WSS was initiated 8 years ago by the Student Scientific Chapter
                at Sharif University of Technology as a global effort to connect
                expert researchers. Currently, WSS is held as a four-day event
                where speakers present their research and ideas each day, while
                also sharing their findings and teaching related topics.

                This event comprises presentations and roundtable discussions
                covering various science and engineering topics. It provides a
                platform for networking and exchange of knowledge among
                participants with a shared interest in computer science and
                engineering.
